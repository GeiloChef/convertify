const e=`# Shekel (weight)

The **shekel** (symbol: ₪ or sometimes represented as "S" in historical contexts) is an ancient unit of weight that was used in the Middle East, particularly in biblical times. Historically, the shekel was not only a unit of weight but also a currency, but in its original form, it primarily measured weight, especially for precious metals like silver and gold.

**In terms of modern weight units**, the shekel has varied over time and geography. Today, it is most commonly associated with a specific weight in grams, especially in historical and archaeological contexts. The modern **Israeli shekel (ILS)** is a currency, but when discussing weight, the shekel often refers to approximately **11.3 grams**.
