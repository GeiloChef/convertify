const n=`# Obolus (obol)

The **Obolus** (symbol: **ob**) is an ancient unit of weight originating from Greece. Historically, it was used to measure small quantities of precious metals, especially gold and silver, in the context of coinage and trade. 

In terms of modern weight measurement, the obolus is roughly equivalent to **a small fraction of a gram**, making it useful for understanding the weight of tiny objects like coins, jewelry, or precious metal fragments. 

### Conversion relationships:
- 1 Obolus ‚âà **0.65 grams** (g)
- Since the obolus was a subdivision of the drachma, which was a standard Greek coin, its weight varied slightly over time and region, but **0.65 g** is a commonly accepted approximation today.

> **Note:** The obolus is not used in contemporary measurement systems but offers valuable historical insight into ancient Greek economy and trade practices.
