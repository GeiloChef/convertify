const n=`# Nanometer (nm)

A **nanometer (nm)** is a unit of length in the **metric system**, equal to **one-billionth of a meter**:

> **1 nm = 0.000000001 meters (10⁻⁹ m) = 0.001 µm**

Nanometers are primarily used to measure **atoms, molecules, wavelengths of light, and nanotechnology components**.

## 🔬 Applications of the Nanometer

### **🔹 Physics & Chemistry**
- **Atoms** are typically **0.1–0.5 nm** in diameter.
- The **DNA double helix** has a width of **~2 nm**.
- **Water molecules** are about **0.3 nm** in size.

### **🔹 Biology & Medicine**
- **Viruses** range from **20 nm (small) to 400 nm (large)**.
- **Cell membranes** are around **7–10 nm thick**.
- The **smallest bacteria** can be **200 nm** in diameter.

### **🔹 Light & Optics**
- **Visible light wavelengths** range from **400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red)**.
- **Ultraviolet (UV) light** has wavelengths between **10 nm and 400 nm**.
- **Infrared light** starts from **700 nm** and goes beyond **1,000 nm**.

### **🔹 Nanotechnology & Engineering**
- **Modern transistors** in microchips are as small as **3 nm**.
- **Carbon nanotubes** are typically **1–2 nm** in diameter.
- **Coatings & surface films** are often measured in nanometers.
