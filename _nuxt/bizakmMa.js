const e=`# Hectogram (hg)

The **hectogram (hg)** is a unit of weight (or mass) in the metric system. It is equal to **100 grams (g)**. The prefix **hecto-** means **100**, so a hectogram is 100 times larger than a gram. 

In the context of the metric system, the hectogram sits between the decagram (dag, 10 g) and the kilogram (kg, 1000 g). It is less commonly used in everyday life but is helpful in scientific measurements, especially when dealing with medium-sized objects.

### Conversion relationships:
- 1 hectogram (hg) = **100 grams (g)**
- 1 kilogram (kg) = **10 hectograms (hg)**
- 1 gram (g) = **0.01 hectograms (hg)**

> The hectogram provides a convenient way to measure objects that are too heavy for grams but less than a kilogram, making it useful for various practical applications.

## üåç Applications

### Grocery and Food Industry
- Weighing fruits and vegetables in markets (e.g., a bunch of bananas weighing 2 hg).
- Measuring portions of cheese or meat in recipes or stores.
- Packaging snacks or small food items that are sold by weight.

### Science and Education
- Used in laboratory settings for measuring small quantities of chemicals.
- Teaching students about metric prefixes and conversions.
- Recording weights of biological specimens in research.

### Sports and Fitness
- Tracking the weight of equipment or accessories, such as small weights or kettlebells.
- Measuring ingredients for nutritional analysis or meal prep.
- Weighing medals or trophies in competitions.

| **10 grams (10 g)** | 10 g             | Slightly larger measurement, e.g., a small apple    |
| **100 grams (100 g)** | 1 hg             | Typical weight of a small bunch of grapes          |
| **1 kilogram (kg)** | 1000 g           | Standard weight for larger objects like groceries |

## üåü Fun Facts
- The **hectogram** is rarely used in everyday life but is quite common in scientific contexts and certain industries.
- In some countries, especially in Europe, you might see food products labeled in **hectograms** instead of grams.
- The **hectogram** is part of the metric system's "metric prefixes" family, which makes conversions straightforward and decimal-based.
