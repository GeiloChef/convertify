const n=`# Millisecond (ms)

A **millisecond** is a unit of time equal to one thousandth of a second. It is expressed as **1 ms = 0.001 seconds**. This tiny fraction of a second allows us to measure extremely brief events with precision. In terms of conversions:

- **1 second = 1,000 milliseconds**
- **1 minute = 60,000 milliseconds**
- **1 hour = 3,600,000 milliseconds**

**Millisecond** is commonly used in contexts where incredibly fast events occur, providing a crucial measure in technology, science, and everyday life.

## üåç Applications

### Technology & Computing
- **Internet latency:** Measuring the delay between a user‚Äôs action and the server response, often in milliseconds.
- **Processing speed:** Modern CPUs perform billions of cycles per second, with some operations measured in milliseconds.
- **Video games:** Frame rendering times are often measured in milliseconds to ensure smooth gameplay.

### Science & Medicine
- **Neuroscience:** Brain signals, such as neuron firing, occur within milliseconds.
- **Medical devices:** Heart rate monitors and ECGs record electrical activity in milliseconds.
- **Chemical reactions:** Certain fast reactions are studied on the millisecond scale to understand reaction dynamics.

### Everyday Life
- **Sports timing:** Sprint races and reaction times are often recorded in milliseconds.
- **Music production:** Digital audio processing and effects are measured in milliseconds to synchronize sounds.
- **Communication:** Voice and video call delays are often measured in milliseconds to improve quality.
