const e=`# Decagram (dag)

The **decagram (dag)** is a unit of mass (or weight) in the metric system. It is equal to **10 grams**. The decagram fits into the metric hierarchy as a smaller unit within the kilogram (kg), which is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). 

> **Conversion relationship:**  
> 1 decagram (dag) = 10 grams (g)  
>  1 kilogram (kg) = 100,000 decagrams (dag)

The decagram is often used in cooking, nutrition, and small-scale measurements because it provides a convenient way to express weights that are too large for grams but smaller than kilograms.
