const n=`# Nanosecond (ns)

A **nanosecond** is a unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (1 ns = 10^-9 seconds). It is a very short duration, used primarily in fields where extremely precise timing is essential. To put it into perspective,:

> **1 nanosecond = 0.000000001 seconds**

This unit helps scientists, engineers, and technologists measure phenomena that happen at incredibly fast speeds, such as electronic signal processing, light travel, and atomic interactions.
