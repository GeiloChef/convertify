const e=`# Pixels per Second (px/sec)

Pixels per second (px/sec) is a unit of velocity that measures **how many pixels** an object moves **in one second** on a digital display or image. It is commonly used in computer graphics, animation, and digital video to quantify the speed of moving objects on screens. 

This unit relates to other units of velocity by considering the spatial resolution (pixels) and the time measurement (seconds). For example, if an object moves 100 pixels in 2 seconds, its velocity is **50 px/sec**. 

**Conversion to other units:**
- Pixels are a digital measurement of space, and their physical size depends on the display resolution and size.
- To relate px/sec to real-world units like meters per second (m/sec), you need to know the pixel density (pixels per inch or pixels per meter).

> **Note:** Pixels per second is primarily a relative measure; actual physical speed depends on the display's pixel density.

## üåç Applications

### Animation & Gaming
- Measuring the speed of characters or objects moving across the screen.
- Adjusting animation timing to ensure smooth motion.
- Synchronizing visual effects with movement speeds.

### Video Editing & Motion Graphics
- Tracking object movements frame-by-frame.
- Setting keyframes for consistent motion during editing.
- Creating realistic camera movements in digital scenes.

### User Interface & Web Design
- Animating scrolling effects or transitions.
- Determining the speed of carousel slides or animated icons.
- Improving user experience by controlling motion pacing.

## üìè Unit Comparisons

| Unit Name            | Description                                      | Equivalent in px/sec (approximate)             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Pixels per Second (px/sec) | Digital measurement of movement speed on screens | -                                            |
| Inches per Second (in/sec)   | Physical distance traveled in one second       | 1 in/sec ‚âà 96 px/sec (assuming 96 PPI)     |
| Centimeters per Second (cm/sec) | Metric unit measuring speed in cm/sec       | 1 cm/sec ‚âà 37.8 px/sec (assuming 96 PPI)  |
| Meters per Second (m/sec)     | SI unit of velocity in meters per second     | 1 m/sec ‚âà 3780 px/sec (assuming 96 PPI)   |

*Note:* These conversions depend on the pixel density (PPI - pixels per inch).

## üåü Fun Facts

- **Pixels per second** can vary greatly depending on the display resolution. A high-refresh-rate gaming monitor might display thousands of px/sec during fast-paced scenes.
- In animation, a typical character walking might move at around **30‚Äì60 px/sec**, but during high-speed action scenes, this can increase to **hundreds of px/sec**.
- The concept of pixels per second is essential in **video game physics** engines to ensure realistic motion and interactions.

## üîÑ Quick Conversions

- **1 inch** = 2.54 cm = 25.4 mm
- **1 foot** = 12 inches = 30.48 cm
- **1 meter** = 100 cm = 1000 mm
- **Pixels per inch (PPI)** varies; common values include:
  - Screen displays: 72 PPI (low-res), 96 PPI (standard), 300+ PPI (high-res retina displays)
- **Example conversions:**
  - 1 cm/sec ‚âà 37.8 px/sec (at 96 PPI)
  - 1 in/sec ‚âà 96 px/sec (at 96 PPI)
  - 1 m/sec ‚âà 3780 px/sec (at 96 PPI)
