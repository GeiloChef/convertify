Terabits per second (Tbps) is a unit of data transfer rate, measuring how many **trillions of bits** are transmitted every second. It is a crucial metric in the world of high-speed data communication, especially as data volumes and network speeds continue to grow exponentially.

**Relationship to other units:**

- 1 Terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits (10^12 bits)
- 1 Terabit per second (Tbps) = 1,000 Gigabits per second (Gbps)
- 1 Gbps = 1,000 Megabits per second (Mbps)
- 1 Mbps = 1,000 Kilobits per second (Kbps)

**Note:**  
*Bits* are the fundamental unit of digital data, and the "per second" indicates the rate at which data is transmitted. When dealing with large-scale data transfer speeds, terabits per second provide a practical way to express extremely high bandwidth capacities.
