const e=`# Feet per Minute (ft/min)

Feet per minute (ft/min) is a unit of velocity that measures how many feet an object travels in one minute. It is commonly used in fields such as transportation, engineering, and manufacturing to describe speeds and rates of movement. 

**Relationship to other units:**  
- 1 foot per minute equals approximately **0.00508 meters per second (m/s)**.  
- To convert feet per minute to miles per hour (mph), multiply by **0.01136**.

> **Note:** The foot is a unit of length primarily used in the United States customary and imperial systems, while the minute is a unit of time. Combining these gives a velocity measurement.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- **Historical origin:** The foot has varied historically by country, but the modern **international foot** is exactly **0.3048 meters**, making conversions to metric units straightforward.
- **Speed in everyday life:** An average human walking speed is about **3 to 4 ft/sec**, which is roughly **180 to 240 ft/min**—showing that feet per minute can describe casual movement as well!
- **In aviation:** Pilots sometimes use feet per minute to measure climb or descent rates during flights, with typical rates around **500 to 2000 ft/min**.
