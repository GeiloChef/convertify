const e=`# Are (unit of area)

The **are** (symbol: **a**) is a unit of area commonly used in measuring land and large surfaces. It is part of the metric system and is related to the **square meter (m²)**, which is the SI base unit for area. 

**1 are = 100 square meters (m²)**.  
This means that the are is a larger unit than the square meter, making it convenient for measuring sizable plots of land without resorting to very large numbers of square meters.

**Conversion note:**  
- 1 hectare (ha) = 100 a (since 1 hectare = 10,000 m² and 1 a = 100 m²)

The are is often used in agriculture, real estate, and land measurement, especially in countries that prefer metric units for land.
