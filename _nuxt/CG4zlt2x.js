const e=`# Femtogram (fg)

The **femtogram (fg)** is an incredibly tiny unit of **weight (mass)** used primarily in scientific contexts to measure extremely small quantities. It is part of the metric system and belongs to the family of units based on grams, which is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI).

**1 femtogram = 10⁻¹⁵ grams**  
This means that a femtogram is one quadrillionth (a millionth of a millionth) of a gram. To put it into perspective, it’s an unimaginably small amount of mass—much smaller than most everyday objects.

### Relationship to other units:
- 1 gram (g) = 1,000,000,000,000,000 femtograms (fg)
- 1 nanogram (ng) = 1,000,000 femtograms
- 1 picogram (pg) = 1,000 femtograms

## 🌍 Applications

**The femtogram is used mainly in scientific research, especially in fields where extremely small masses are relevant. Here are some common applications:**

### **Biology & Medicine**
- Measuring the mass of tiny biological molecules such as proteins and DNA fragments.
- Quantifying nanogram to femtogram levels of drug compounds in pharmacology.
- Analyzing cellular components and their mass during molecular biology experiments.

### **Physics & Chemistry**
- Studying particles like aerosols, nanomaterials, or radioactive isotopes at the quantum or atomic scale.
- Measuring the mass of individual atoms or small clusters in experimental physics.

### **Environmental Science**
- Detecting trace amounts of pollutants or contaminants in water and air samples.
- Analyzing particulate matter that is too small to be measured in larger units.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- **A femtogram is about the weight of a few large proteins**—for example, the average weight of a single hemoglobin molecule is roughly 64,500 femtograms.
- **Measuring in femtograms requires highly sensitive equipment** like atomic force microscopes or mass spectrometers, highlighting the incredible precision of modern science.
- **In the universe of tiny particles, femtograms are the 'everyday' units scientists work with** when studying molecules and atomic-scale phenomena.
