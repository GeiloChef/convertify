const n=`# Hour (hr)

The **hour** is a unit of time commonly used to measure durations, periods, and intervals within daily life and various fields. One hour is traditionally defined as **1/24th** of a day, meaning there are **24 hours** in a day. In the metric system, it is a standard unit for time measurement, especially in contexts like transportation, scheduling, and timekeeping.

**Conversions:**
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 hour = 3,600 seconds

Understanding hours helps us organize our day, coordinate activities, and understand time intervals across different contexts.
