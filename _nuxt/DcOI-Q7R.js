const e=`# Square Centimeter (cm²)

The **square centimeter (cm²)** is a unit of area measurement commonly used to quantify small surfaces, especially in contexts like geometry, design, and everyday measurements. It represents the area of a square with sides measuring exactly 1 centimeter each.

**Relationship to other units:**

- 1 **square meter (m²)** = 10,000 **square centimeters (cm²)**  
- 1 **square millimeter (mm²)** = 0.01 **square centimeters (cm²)**  
- 1 **square inch (in²)** ≈ 6.4516 **square centimeters (cm²)**

In essence, the square centimeter provides a convenient way to measure smaller areas with precision, especially in fields like engineering, crafts, and biology.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- The **square centimeter** is often used in printing and packaging to specify small surface areas, making it a practical choice for detailed work.
- Despite its small size, the area of a standard postage stamp typically ranges from about 20 to 50 cm², illustrating how tiny surfaces are measured precisely with cm².
- In digital imaging, pixel dimensions are often converted to physical areas in square centimeters for printing and display calibration.

## 🔄 Quick Conversions

- 1 cm = 0.01 m = 10 mm = 0.394 in  
- 1 cm² = 100 mm²  
- 1 in² ≈ 6.45 cm²  
- 1 ft² ≈ 929 cm²  

*Remember:* When measuring small surfaces, the square centimeter offers an excellent balance between detail and simplicity!`;export{e as default};
