const e=`# Hectare (ha)

The **hectare** is a unit of area commonly used in measuring large plots of land. It is part of the metric system and is especially popular in agriculture, forestry, and land management. One hectare is equal to **10,000 square meters**—which makes it a convenient way to quantify sizable areas without resorting to complex numbers. 

In relation to other units:
- **1 hectare = 10,000 m²**
- **1 hectare ≈ 2.471 acres**
- **1 hectare = 100 ares** (another metric unit for land measurement)

The hectare provides a practical, standardized measure that bridges the gap between smaller units like square meters and larger units like acres, making it easier to communicate about land areas across different regions.

## 🌍 Applications

### Agriculture & Farming
- Farmers often measure their fields in hectares to estimate crop yields.
- Land for large farms or plantations is typically bought, sold, or leased based on hectares.
- Agricultural planning and zoning often use hectares to define plot sizes.

### Urban Planning & Development
- City planners use hectares to designate zones and allocate land for parks, residential, or commercial development.
- Real estate listings frequently specify land area in hectares, especially outside the U.S.

### Environmental & Conservation Efforts
- Conservationists measure protected areas, forests, or wildlife reserves in hectares.
- Environmental impact assessments often include hectares to specify the size of affected or preserved land.
