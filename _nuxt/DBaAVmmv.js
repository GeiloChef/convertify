const e=`# Catties (kg)

The **cattie**, more commonly known as the **kilogram** and symbolized as **kg**, is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). It is widely used around the world to measure weight and mass, especially in scientific, commercial, and everyday contexts. One **cattie (kg)** is defined as **the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram**, a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.

**Conversions:**
- 1 cattie (kg) = 1000 grams (g)
- 1 cattie (kg) ≈ 2.20462 pounds (lb)
- 1 cattie (kg) ≈ 35.274 ounces (oz)

> Remember, **mass** and **weight** are related but distinct concepts**: weight depends on gravity, while mass is a measure of matter. However, in everyday use, "weight" often refers to mass, especially in the metric system.

## 🌍 Applications

### Scientific and Industrial Uses
- Measuring the mass of chemicals and ingredients in laboratories.
- Quantifying raw materials like metals, plastics, and other commodities.
- Calibration of scales and measurement devices.

### Commercial and Consumer Contexts
- Labeling products in grocery stores (e.g., fruits, vegetables, packaged goods).
- Shipping and logistics to determine parcel weights.
- Weighing jewelry, precious metals, and collectibles.

### Personal and Athletic Use
- Measuring body weight for health and fitness tracking.
- Weighing luggage before travel.
- Sports competitions where precise weight categories are essential.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- The **kilogram** was originally defined in 1889 by a physical object—the **International Prototype Kilogram**—but since 2019, it's been defined in terms of fundamental constants, making it more stable over time.
- The term **"cattie"** is an older, less common name sometimes used colloquially in certain regions, but **"kilogram"** is the official SI unit.
- The kilogram is the only SI unit still based on a physical object; all others are defined through constants of nature.

## 🔄 Quick Conversions

- 1 kg = 1000 g
- 1 kg ≈ 2.20462 lb
- 1 lb ≈ 16 oz
- 1 kg ≈ 35.274 oz
- 1 g = 0.001 kg
- 1 oz ≈ 28.3495 g
