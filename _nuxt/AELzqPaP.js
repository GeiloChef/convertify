const n=`# Dunam (دونم)

The **dunam** is a traditional unit of area commonly used in Middle Eastern countries, particularly in Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. It is primarily employed for measuring land and agricultural areas. 

**1 dunam** is equivalent to **1,000 square meters (m²)**, which makes it a convenient and practical unit for land measurement. To put it into perspective: 

- **1 dunam = 1,000 m²**
- Since **1 hectare = 10,000 m²**, **1 dunam** equals **0.1 hectares**.
- In other units: **1 dunam ≈ 0.247 acres** or roughly **2,472 square yards**.

This unit is part of the metric system's broader context, with conversions to square meters being straightforward, but it remains a traditional measure in regional land transactions and agriculture.
