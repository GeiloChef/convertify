const n=`# Kilogram (kg)

The **kilogram (kg)** is the fundamental unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). It is widely used worldwide to measure weight or mass, especially in contexts like science, commerce, and everyday life. The kilogram is defined by the **Planck constant**, making it a highly precise and stable standard. 

In relation to other units:
- 1 kilogram equals **1000 grams (g)**
- 1 kilogram is approximately **2.20462 pounds (lb)**
- 1 kilogram equals **1,000,000 milligrams (mg)**

**Conversions are straightforward**, making the kilogram a versatile unit for various measurements.

## üåü Fun Facts

- The **kilogram** was originally defined by a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder stored in France, known as the **International Prototype Kilogram**. Since 2019, it is defined by a fundamental constant, the Planck constant.
- The **word "kilogram"** comes from the Greek "kilo" meaning "thousand" and Latin "gramma," meaning "small weight."
- The kilogram is the only SI unit still physically represented by a specific object, rather than a fundamental constant.
