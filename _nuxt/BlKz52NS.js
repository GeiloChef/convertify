const e=`# Macrometer (Mm)

A **macrometer (Mm)** is a unit of length in the **metric system**, equal to **one million meters**:

> **1 Mm = 1,000,000 meters (10⁶ m) = 1,000 km**

The macrometer is rarely used in everyday measurements but is helpful in **astronomy, geophysics, and large-scale mapping**.

## 🌍 Applications of the Macrometer

### **🔹 Geography & Earth Science**
- **Earth’s diameter** is approximately **12.7 Mm**.
- The distance from **London to Berlin** is around **1 Mm**.
- **The thickness of the Earth’s crust** varies between **5–70 km (0.005–0.07 Mm)**.

### **🔹 Astronomy**
- **The Moon’s diameter** is about **3.47 Mm**.
- The **distance from the Earth to the Moon** is about **384 Mm**.
- **The Sun’s diameter** is approximately **1,392 Mm**.

### **🔹 Large-Scale Engineering**
- **Undersea internet cables**, like the **Transatlantic Cable**, span around **6 Mm**.
- **High-speed rail networks** in some countries stretch over **10 Mm** in total length.
