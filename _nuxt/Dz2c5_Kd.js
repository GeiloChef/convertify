const e=`# Astronomical Units per Hour (AU/h)

**Astronomical Units per Hour (AU/h)** is a unit of velocity that measures how many astronomical units (AU) an object travels in one hour. An *astronomical unit* (AU) is approximately equal to the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, about **149,597,870.7 kilometers (92,955,807.3 miles)**. 

Converting between AU/h and more familiar units involves understanding the relationship between distance and time:

- **1 AU/h** = about **149,597,870.7 km per hour**
- To convert AU/h to km/s:  
  \\(\\text{km/s} = \\frac{\\text{AU/h} \\times 149,597,870.7 \\text{ km}}{3600 \\text{ s}}\\)

This unit is particularly useful in astronomy for expressing the velocities of celestial objects over large distances, where using kilometers per second (km/s) may be less intuitive when dealing with solar system scales.

## üåç Applications

### Space Missions and Celestial Mechanics
- Calculating the velocity of spacecraft traveling between planets, often expressed in AU/h for ease.
- Assessing the orbital velocities of planets and comets within our solar system.
- Estimating how quickly solar system objects move relative to the Sun or Earth.

### Astronomical Observations
- Describing the apparent motion of stars and distant objects over time.
- Modeling the movement of objects in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud.

### Education and Outreach
- Explaining the vast scales of our solar system in a more comprehensible way.
- Demonstrating how fast objects travel in space using familiar units like AU and hours.

## üåü Fun Facts

- **The Earth's orbital speed around the Sun is about 0.0172 AU/h**, which means it travels roughly 1 AU in about 8.8 months!
- **Voyager 1** is currently moving at about **3.6 AU/h**, making it one of the fastest spacecraft relative to the Sun.
- Using AU/h helps astronomers visualize the vast distances and high velocities in our solar system without dealing with unwieldy numbers like kilometers per second.
