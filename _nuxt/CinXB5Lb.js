const e=`# Megagram (Mg)

The **megagram** (symbol: **Mg**) is a unit of mass used primarily in the metric system. It is equal to **1,000,000 grams**, or **1,000 kilograms**. In other words, the megagram is a convenient way to express large masses without resorting to lengthy numbers of grams or kilograms.

**Relationship to other units:**
- 1 megagram (Mg) = 1,000,000 grams (g)
- 1 megagram (Mg) = 1,000 kilograms (kg)
- 1 kilogram (kg) = 1,000 grams (g)

**Conversion table:**
| Unit            | Equivalent to Megagram (Mg) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| 1 gram (g)     | 0.000001 Mg                  |
| 1 kilogram (kg)| 0.001 Mg                     |
| 1 metric ton (t) | 1 Mg                        |

> **Note:** The megagram is often called a "tonne" or "metric ton" in many contexts, especially in industries like shipping, agriculture, and manufacturing.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- The **megagram** is often called a **"tonne"** outside the United States, especially in Europe and international standards.
- The **megagram** is part of the metric system, which is based on powers of ten, making conversions straightforward.
- In the U.S., the term **"ton"** typically refers to the **short ton** (2,000 lbs), which is different from a megagram, but the metric tonne (Mg) aligns with the **long** or **metric ton**.

## 🔄 Quick Conversions

- **1 Mg = 1,000 kg = 1,000,000 g**
- **1 kg = 1,000 g = 0.001 Mg**
- **1 g = 0.000001 Mg**

**Approximate equivalents:**
- **1 Mg ≈ 2,204.62 pounds (lbs)**
- **1 Mg ≈ 1.102 short tons (US)**
