const n=`# Fathom (ftm)

The **fathom (ftm)** is a traditional unit of length used primarily for measuring the **depth of water**. Rooted in maritime history, it has long been essential in **navigation, fishing, and oceanography**.

> **1 fathom = 6 feet = 72 inches = 1.8288 meters**

The word "fathom" comes from the Old English *fæðm*, meaning "to embrace" or "encompass." This reflects the original definition: the **span of a person's outstretched arms**. Before standardization, sailors measured depth by literally extending a rope from fingertip to fingertip.
