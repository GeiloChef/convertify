const e=`# Miles per hour (mph)

Miles per hour (mph) is a unit of velocity that measures the number of miles traveled in one hour. It is commonly used primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom to express speeds of vehicles, aircraft, and other moving objects. 

**Relationship to other units:**  
- 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers  
- Therefore, **1 mph ≈ 1.60934 km/h**  
- To convert mph to meters per second (m/s), use:  
  **1 mph ≈ 0.44704 m/s**  

**In essence**, miles per hour provides a way to understand and compare speeds over longer distances, especially in contexts where miles are a familiar measure of distance.

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- **Historical origin:** The term "mile per hour" dates back to when distances were measured using miles and time with hours, making it a traditional measure for vehicle speed.
- **Speed of sound:** The speed of sound in air is approximately 767 mph at sea level, so a jet traveling at 600 mph is flying close to Mach 0.8, a high subsonic speed.
- **Popular culture:** The phrase "miles per hour" is often associated with speedometers in cars, symbolizing speed and excitement in movies and racing.
