const e=`# Decare (da)  

The **decare** (symbol: **da**) is a unit of **area** commonly used in the metric system, especially in contexts like land measurement and agriculture.  
**1 decare = 10 ares**  
Since **1 are** (a) equals **100 square meters (m²)**, it follows that:  
**1 decare = 1,000 square meters (m²)**  

**Conversions to other units:**  
- 1 decare = 0.1 hectares (ha)  
- 1 decare = 10,000 square centimeters (cm²)  
- 1 decare ≈ 0.247 acres (approximate, since 1 acre ≈ 4,046.86 m²)  

Understanding the decare helps bridge the gap between the metric system and traditional land measurements, making it useful for farmers, land developers, and urban planners.  

## 🌍 Applications

### Agriculture & Land Measurement  
- Farmers often measure plots of land in decares to estimate crop yields or plan land use.  
- Real estate listings for farmland or large plots may specify size in decares for clarity.  
- Governments and municipalities sometimes record land parcels in decares for administrative purposes.  

### Environmental & Conservation Projects  
- Monitoring forested areas or parks in decares helps quantify conserved land.  
- Measuring green spaces in urban planning projects often utilizes decares for clarity in large-scale maps.  
- Assessing the size of protected zones or wildlife habitats in decares for policy and planning.  

### Sports & Recreation Fields  
- Large sports fields or parks are sometimes measured in decares for standardized planning and construction.  
- Planning community gardens or recreational spaces often involves decare measurements to ensure adequate space.  
- Urban developers may allocate land in decares for new sports complexes or public parks.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- The **decare** originated from the traditional European land measurement system and is still used in some countries like Italy, France, and Spain.  
- In agriculture, the decare is particularly popular in Italy and some Balkan countries, making it a familiar unit for farmers in those regions.  
- Because it equals **1,000 square meters**, the decare is a convenient unit for quick mental calculations of medium-sized plots of land.  

## 🔄 Quick Conversions

- 1 cm² = 0.0001 m²  
- 1 m² = 100 cm²  
- 1 hectare = 10,000 m²  
- 1 acre ≈ 4,046.86 m²  
- 1 decare = 0.1 hectares = 1,000 m² = 10,000,000 cm²
