const e=`# Meters per Minute (m/min)

Meters per minute (m/min) is a unit of velocity that measures how many meters an object travels in one minute. It is a common unit used to describe the speed of movement in various fields, especially where practical, real-world measurement is important. 

**Relationship to other units:**

- 1 meter per minute = approximately 0.0167 meters per second (m/s)
- To convert meters per minute to kilometers per hour (km/h), multiply by 0.06
- To convert meters per minute to miles per hour (mph), multiply by approximately 0.0373

**In essence**, meters per minute provides a straightforward way to understand how fast something is moving over a human-perceivable time frame, especially in contexts like walking speed, conveyor belts, or mechanical processes.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- **Historical usage:** Meters per minute was particularly popular in early industrial settings before the widespread adoption of SI units like meters per second.
- **Speed of a brisk walk:** An average human walking speed is about 80–100 m/min, making meters per minute a practical unit for everyday movement.
- **In nature:** The migration speed of some animals, like certain fish or birds, can be measured in meters per minute, helping scientists understand their behavior and energy expenditure.
