const n=`# Kilometers per hour (km/h)

Kilometers per hour (km/h) is a unit of **velocity** that measures how many kilometers an object travels in one hour. It is commonly used worldwide, especially in countries that use the metric system, to express **speed**—how fast something is moving. 

Since **1 kilometer (km)** equals **1,000 meters (m)**, and **1 hour (h)** equals **3,600 seconds (s)**, km/h provides an intuitive way to describe speeds in everyday life, transportation, and sports.

**Conversion to other units:**
- To convert km/h to meters per second (m/s), multiply by **(1000 / 3600) ≈ 0.2778**.
- To convert km/h to miles per hour (mph), multiply by **0.6214**.

> **In summary:**
> - 1 km/h ≈ 0.2778 m/s
> - 1 km/h ≈ 0.6214 mph

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- The **fastest land-speed record** was set by ThrustSSC, reaching **1,227 km/h (763 mph)**, which is over **1,000 times** the speed of a typical city car.
- In many countries, **speed limits are given in km/h**, but in the United States, mph is more common—yet, km/h is still used in scientific contexts worldwide.
- The **speed of sound** in air at sea level is approximately **1,235 km/h**; jets often fly at speeds close to or exceeding this, measured in km/h.
