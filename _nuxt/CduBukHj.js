A **month** is a unit of time used to measure durations based on the lunar or solar calendar systems. Typically, a month represents roughly **1/12th** of a year, making it a convenient period for scheduling and planning. Its length varies depending on the calendar system:

- **Gregorian calendar** (most widely used today):  
  - *Common months* have either **28, 30, or 31 days**.  
  - *February* usually has **28 days**, but **29 days** in leap years.  
  - *Other months*:  
    | January | 31 days |  
    | February | 28 or 29 days |  
    | March | 31 days |  
    | April | 30 days |  
    | May | 31 days |  
    | June | 30 days |  
    | July | 31 days |  
    | August | 31 days |  
    | September | 30 days |  
    | October | 31 days |  
    | November | 30 days |  
    | December | 31 days |

- **Relationship to other units**:  
  - 1 month ≈ **30.44 days** (average length in the Gregorian calendar).
