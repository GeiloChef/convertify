const e=`# Astronomical Units per Day (AU/day)

The **astronomical units per day (AU/day)** is a unit of velocity used primarily in astronomy to describe the speed at which celestial objects move through space. It measures how many **astronomical units** (the average distance between Earth and the Sun, approximately 149,597,870.7 kilometers or about 93 million miles) an object travels **per day**.

**Conversion relationship:**  
- 1 AU ‚âà 149,597,870.7 km  
- 1 day = 86,400 seconds

So, to convert AU/day to km/s, you can use:  
**1 AU/day ‚âà 149,597,870.7 km / 86,400 s ‚âà 1,730 km/s**

This unit is handy for expressing planetary or cometary velocities relative to Earth's orbit, providing a more intuitive sense of how fast objects move in our solar system.

## üåç Applications

### Space Missions and Planetary Science
- **Tracking spacecraft:** Mission planners often measure spacecraft speed in AU/day when plotting trajectories within the solar system.
- **Orbital mechanics:** Understanding the orbital velocities of planets and moons relative to the Sun.
- **Comet and asteroid tracking:** Determining how quickly these objects approach or recede from the Sun and Earth.

### Astronomical Observations
- **Measuring celestial object speeds:** Such as the movement of stars or other solar system bodies relative to the Sun.
- **Studying orbital decay:** Observing how the orbits of satellites and natural bodies change over time.

### Educational and Scientific Context
- **Teaching celestial mechanics:** Demonstrating how objects move at different speeds in space.
- **Comparing velocities:** Between various celestial bodies within our solar system in an accessible unit.

| 1 AU/day                   | 1 AU/day                   | The standard measure in this unit                 |

*Note:*  
- **Earth's orbital velocity** is about **0.0172 AU/day** (~29.78 km/s).  
- **Speed of light** is approximately **173 AU/day**.

## üåü Fun Facts

- **Fast movers:** Some comets can reach speeds of up to **1 AU/day** when close to the Sun, making them appear to zip across the sky at incredible rates.
- **Relativity in space:** Although AU/day is convenient for solar system scales, it‚Äôs vastly slower than the speed of light, emphasizing how slow celestial motion appears on an interstellar scale.
- **Historical origin:** The term "astronomical unit" was historically based on Earth's orbit, making AU/day a natural extension for measuring how quickly objects traverse these distances.
