const e=`# Astronomical Unit (AU)

The **Astronomical Unit (AU)** is a fundamental unit of length used primarily in astronomy to describe distances within our Solar System. It is approximately equal to the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. This unit provides a practical way to express vast distances between celestial bodies in a manageable scale.

**Conversion and Relationship:**
- 1 AU ‚âà **149,597,870.7 kilometers** (km)
- 1 AU ‚âà **92,955,807.3 miles** (mi)
- In meters, 1 AU ‚âà **149,597,870,700 m**

The Astronomical Unit serves as a baseline for measuring planetary orbits and other solar system distances, making it easier for astronomers and students to visualize these immense scales.

## üåü Fun Facts
- The concept of the Astronomical Unit was first used in the 19th century to help astronomers measure distances without relying solely on parallax.
- The AU is not a fixed distance; it varies slightly due to Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, but the standard value is used for consistency.
- Historically, the AU was determined through observations of planetary transits, such as the transit of Venus, which helped refine its value.
