const n=`# Grain (gr)

The **grain** (symbol: **gr**) is a traditional unit of weight primarily used to measure small quantities, especially in contexts like precious metals, firearms, and pharmaceuticals. It is part of the imperial and US customary systems of measurement.

**1 grain = exactly 1/7000 of a pound (lb)**, which makes it a very small unit of weight. In terms of more common units, **1 grain ≈ 0.0648 grams**. This conversion allows you to see how grains relate to the metric system, making it easier to compare and convert measurements across different standards.

> **Note:** The grain is still used today in specific fields, such as measuring gunpowder, bullets, and drugs, but it is less common in everyday measurements.
