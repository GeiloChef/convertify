# Milligram (mg)

The **milligram (mg)** is a unit of **mass or weight** in the metric system. It is equal to **one thousandth of a gram**, making it a very small unit used to measure tiny quantities. 

**Conversion relationships:**
- 1 gram (g) = 1,000 milligrams (mg)
- 1 kilogram (kg) = 1,000,000 milligrams (mg)
- 1 milligram = 0.001 grams

The milligram is commonly used in contexts where precise, small measurements are essential, such as in medicine, chemistry, and food labeling.

> **Note:** Because of its small size, the milligram is ideal for measuring substances like medication dosages, precious metals, and small chemical quantities.

## 🌍 Applications

### Medical and Pharmaceutical
- Measuring drug dosages such as vitamins and supplements.
- Weighing active ingredients in prescription medicines.
- Determining precise amounts of chemicals for laboratory experiments.

### Food and Nutrition
- Labeling nutrient content (e.g., milligrams of sodium or vitamins) on food packaging.
- Measuring tiny amounts of additives or preservatives.
- Analyzing mineral content in food products.

### Scientific and Industrial
- Quantifying small quantities of chemicals in research.
- Measuring trace elements in environmental samples.
- Weighing small components in manufacturing processes.
