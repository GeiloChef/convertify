> **1 Long Ton (UK) = 2,240 lbs**
> **1 Long Ton (UK) ‚âà 1.016 metric tons (tonne)**

## üåç Applications

### Maritime and Shipping
- **Cargo weight measurement:** Long tons are used to specify the weight of ships' cargo, especially in the UK and maritime industries.
- **Ship displacement calculations:** Determining how much water a vessel displaces, measured in long tons.
- **Fuel and lubricant quantities:** Often expressed in long tons for large ships.

### Engineering and Construction
- **Heavy machinery:** Weight of large equipment and industrial machinery is often given in long tons.
- **Material handling:** Bulk materials like coal, cement, and aggregates are sometimes measured in long tons.
- **Structural load assessments:** Engineers may specify load capacities in long tons, especially for bridges and large infrastructures.

### Agriculture and Livestock
- **Bulk commodity sales:** Farmers and suppliers may quote quantities of grain, feed, or livestock in long tons.
- **Transport documentation:** Trucking companies and freight services use long tons to specify shipment weights.
- **Farming equipment:** Heavy machinery and tools are occasionally weighed in long tons for precision.
