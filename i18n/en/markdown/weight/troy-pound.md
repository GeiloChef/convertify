# Troy Pound (lbₜ)

The **troy pound** (abbreviated as **lbₜ**) is a historic unit of weight primarily used in the measurement of precious metals such as gold, silver, and gemstones. Unlike the more common avoirdupois pound, the troy pound has a different weight value and is part of the troy weight system, which dates back to medieval France and was later adopted in England.

### Relationship to other units:
- **1 troy pound (lbₜ) = 12 troy ounces (ozₜ)**
- **1 troy pound ≈ 373.2 grams**
- **Compared to the avoirdupois pound (≈ 453.6 grams), the troy pound is about 20% lighter.**

This makes the troy pound especially useful in contexts where precise measurement of precious metals and gemstones is essential.
