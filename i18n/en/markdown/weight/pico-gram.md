# Picogram (pg)

A **picogram** is a unit of mass in the metric system, representing **one trillionth (10‚Åª¬π¬≤)** of a gram. The symbol for this unit is **pg**. To put it into perspective:

> 1 pg = 0.000000000001 grams

**Conversion hierarchy:**

- 1 gram (g) = 1,000,000,000,000 picograms (pg)
- 1 milligram (mg) = 1,000,000 pg
- 1 microgram (Œºg) = 1,000 pg

This tiny unit is used mainly in scientific contexts where extremely small masses are involved, such as in biology and chemistry.
