# Pound (lb)

The **pound** (symbol: **lb**) is a unit of weight commonly used in the United States and some other countries to measure the heaviness of objects and materials. It is part of the imperial and US customary systems of measurement. 

A **pound** is defined as exactly **16 ounces (oz)**. In the metric system, the pound is approximately equal to **0.45359237 kilograms (kg)**, making it a vital conversion point between imperial and metric units.

> **Note:** The pound is different from the unit of force called the **pound-force**, which is used in physics, but here we focus on the pound as a measure of weight (mass).
