# Nanogram (ng)

The **nanogram (ng)** is a unit of mass within the metric system, specifically used to measure extremely small weights. It is equal to **one billionth of a gram** (1 ng = 10⁻⁹ g). To put this into perspective, it is **1,000 times smaller** than a microgram (µg) and **1,000,000 times smaller** than a milligram (mg). 

### Relationship to other units:
- 1 nanogram (ng) = 10⁻⁹ grams (g)
- 1 microgram (µg) = 10⁻⁶ grams (g)
- 1 milligram (mg) = 10⁻³ grams (g)
- 1 gram (g) = 1,000,000,000 nanograms (ng)

This makes the nanogram especially useful for measuring very tiny quantities, such as in scientific research, pharmaceuticals, and environmental samples.
