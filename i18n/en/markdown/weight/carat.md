# Carat (ct)

The **carat (ct)** is a unit of *mass* used primarily to measure the weight of gemstones, especially diamonds and other precious stones. One carat is exactly **200 milligrams (mg)**, which is **0.2 grams (g)**. This makes the carat a very specific and standardized measure in gemology. 

In terms of conversions:
- **1 carat (ct) = 0.2 grams (g)**
- **5 carats (ct) = 1 gram (g)**
- **100 carats (ct) = 20 grams (g)**

The carat is part of a broader category of weight units, and understanding its relationship to grams and milligrams helps in precise measurement and valuation of gemstones.
