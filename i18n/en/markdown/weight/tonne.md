# Tonne (t)

The **tonne** (symbol: **t**), also known as the **metric ton**, is a unit of **mass** used primarily in the metric system. It is equal to **1,000 kilograms** (kg) or approximately **2,204.62 pounds**. The tonne is widely used internationally, especially in contexts involving large quantities of goods, commodities, or materials.

**Conversion relationships:**

- 1 tonne = **1,000 kg**
- 1 tonne ‚âà **2,204.62 lbs**
- 1 tonne = **1,000,000 grams** (g)
- 1 tonne = **1,000,000,000 milligrams** (mg)

This unit provides a convenient way to measure heavy objects or large amounts of material without resorting to cumbersome numbers.

## üåç Applications

### Industry & Manufacturing
- Shipping companies measure cargo weight in tonnes to determine freight costs.
- Construction projects often estimate the total weight of materials like steel or concrete in tonnes.
- Agricultural sectors track harvest weights, such as wheat or rice, in tonnes.

### Environment & Ecology
- Monitoring the biomass of forests or large ecosystems in tonnes.
- Measuring carbon emissions or waste in large-scale environmental reports.
- Counting the total weight of collected recyclables or waste materials.

### Transportation & Logistics
- Weighing large vehicles like trucks and ships in tonnes.
- Fuel consumption and efficiency calculations for heavy machinery.
- Cargo loading and capacity planning based on tonne measurements.

## üåü Fun Facts
- The **metric tonne** was officially adopted in France in 1795 during the French Revolution.
- The term **"tonne"** is derived from the Latin word *tonna*, which was a large cask or barrel used in medieval times.
- In shipping, a **"tonnage"** can refer to both weight and volume, but the metric tonne strictly measures mass.
