# Quintal (q)

The **quintal** is a unit of weight commonly used in various parts of the world, especially in agriculture and trade. It is traditionally equivalent to **100 kilograms (kg)**, making it a convenient unit for measuring large quantities of produce or commodities. The term **"quintal"** originates from the Latin word *quintƒÅlia*, meaning "five hundred," though its modern usage varies geographically. 

In the metric system, the **quintal** is standardized as **100 kg**. This means:
> **1 quintal = 100 kilograms = 220.462 pounds**

The quintal serves as a practical measurement in contexts where dealing with large weights, such as harvests or shipments, is common. It offers an easier way to express large quantities without resorting to extensive decimal notation.
