# Minute (min)

A **minute** is a unit of time commonly used to measure short durations. It is equal to **60 seconds** and is a subdivision of the hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this unit helps us capture intervals that are longer than seconds but shorter than hours, making it particularly useful in daily life, transportation schedules, and various timed activities.

> **Conversion reminder:**  
> 1 minute = 60 seconds  
> 1 hour = 60 minutes

## 🌍 Applications

### Daily Life
- Setting alarms or timers on clocks and smartphones.
- Timing cooking or baking processes, such as boiling eggs for 3–5 minutes.
- Measuring workout intervals or rest periods during exercise.

### Transportation & Scheduling
- Flight durations often include minutes, e.g., "The flight will take approximately 90 minutes."
- Public transport schedules, like buses arriving every 15–30 minutes.
- Movie durations, typically around 90–120 minutes.

### Scientific & Technical
- Recording reaction times in experiments.
- Measuring intervals in sports, such as a 100-meter sprint lasting about 10 seconds, which is often discussed in minutes when considering longer events.
- Timing computer processes or network latencies.
