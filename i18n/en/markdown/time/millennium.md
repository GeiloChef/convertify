# Millennium (ky)

A **millennium** is a unit of time representing **1,000 years**. It is commonly used to describe long historical periods, future projections, or significant spans in history. Since a year is approximately the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, a millennium equals **1,000 Earth years**.

In terms of conversions:
- **1 millennium (ky) = 1,000 years**
- **1 century = 100 years**
- **10 centuries = 1 millennium**

This makes the millennium a useful measure for discussing large-scale historical and future timelines, especially in fields like history, archaeology, and future studies.
