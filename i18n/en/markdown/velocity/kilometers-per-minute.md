# Kilometers per Minute (km/min)

Kilometers per minute (km/min) is a unit of **velocity** that measures how many kilometers an object travels in one minute. It combines the metric length unit **kilometer (km)** with the time unit **minute (min)**, providing a convenient way to express speed, especially in contexts where time is measured in minutes.

### Relationship to Other Units
- 1 km/min equals **60 kilometers per hour (km/h)** because:
  
  \[
  1\, \text{km/min} = 60\, \text{km/h}
  \]
  
- To convert km/min to meters per second (m/s):
  
  \[
  1\, \text{km/min} = \frac{1000\, \text{meters}}{60\, \text{seconds}} \approx 16.67\, \text{m/s}
  \]
  
> **Note:** Since 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 minute = 60 seconds, conversions between km/min and other speed units involve simple multiplication or division by these factors.

## 🌍 Applications

**Kilometers per minute** is particularly useful in various real-world scenarios:

### Transportation
- **High-speed trains** often reach speeds of several kilometers per minute, especially during rapid acceleration phases.
- **Aircraft** during takeoff or landing maneuvers may be described in km/min for precise ground speed measurements.
- **Marathon runners** might be analyzed in terms of km/min to assess their pace over different segments.

### Space and Astronomy
- **Spacecraft velocities** relative to planets or stations are sometimes expressed in km/min when analyzing orbital adjustments.
- **Rocket launches** involve rapid velocity changes measured in km/min during ascent phases.

### Emergency and Military Operations
- **Rapid ground movements** of military vehicles or emergency response teams in wide areas are sometimes tracked in km/min.
- **Missile speeds** are often given in km/min for tactical calculations over short distances.
