# Millimeters per second (mm/s)

Millimeters per second (mm/s) is a unit of velocity that measures how many millimeters an object travels in one second. It is a **metric unit** commonly used to express very small speeds, especially in fields requiring precise measurement, such as engineering, biomechanics, and robotics.

Since 1 centimeter (cm) = 10 millimeters (mm), and 1 meter (m) = 1000 millimeters, you can easily convert between mm/s and other velocity units:

- **1 m/s = 1000 mm/s**
- **1 cm/s = 10 mm/s**
- **1 km/h ≈ 0.2778 m/s ≈ 277.8 mm/s**

Understanding the relationship between mm/s and other units helps in making accurate measurements across various applications.

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- **Tiny but precise:** Millimeters per second is often used in fields where measuring tiny movements is crucial, such as in nanotechnology.
- **Speed of a snail:** The average garden snail moves at about 0.013 mm/s, which is well below 1 mm/s!
- **In space:** Micro-movements of celestial bodies or spacecraft components are sometimes measured in mm/s to ensure ultra-precise navigation and control.
