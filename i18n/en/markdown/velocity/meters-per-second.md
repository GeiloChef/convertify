# Meters per second (m/s)

Meters per second (m/s) is the SI (International System of Units) standard unit for measuring **velocity**. It indicates how many meters an object travels in one second. This unit is fundamental in physics and engineering when describing the speed of moving objects.

**Relationship to other units:**
- 1 km/h (kilometer per hour) ‚âà 0.27778 m/s
- 1 mph (mile per hour) ‚âà 0.44704 m/s
- 1 ft/s (foot per second) ‚âà 0.3048 m/s

You can convert between these units easily using these ratios, helping you understand how speed compares across different measurement systems.

## üåç Applications

**1. Transportation**
- Speed limits on roads are often expressed in km/h, but engineers and scientists measure actual vehicle speeds in m/s.
- The velocity of airplanes during cruising is often given in meters per second for precise calculations.
- In maritime navigation, ships' speeds are sometimes measured in m/s for accuracy in navigation systems.

**2. Sports & Athletics**
- Sprinters' speeds over short distances are typically around 10‚Äì12 m/s.
- Tracking the velocity of athletes helps optimize training and improve performance.
- Measuring the speed of projectiles or balls (e.g., baseballs or golf balls) often involves m/s.

**3. Physics & Scientific Research**
- Studying the velocity of particles in experiments, such as electrons in a collider, is expressed in m/s.
- Analyzing the movement of celestial bodies, like spacecraft velocities, often involves m/s.
- Calculating the speed of waves, such as sound or light in various mediums, uses m/s as the standard measure.

## üåü Fun Facts

- The fastest animal in the world, the peregrine falcon during its hunting dive, can reach speeds of over 80 m/s (~177 mph).
- The average human walking speed is about 1.4 m/s, while running speeds for athletes can exceed 10 m/s.
- Light travels at approximately 299,792,458 m/s, which is about 1 million times faster than typical vehicle speeds!
