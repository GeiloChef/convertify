# Revolutions per Minute (rpm)

Revolutions per Minute (rpm) is a unit that measures the **rotational speed** of an object‚Äîhow many full turns or revolutions it completes in one minute. It is commonly used in contexts involving rotating machinery, engines, and wheels. 

In relation to other units:
- **1 rpm** equals **1 revolution per 60 seconds**.
- To convert rpm to **angular velocity** in radians per second (rad/s), multiply by \(2\pi/60\).
- To convert rpm to **linear velocity** (e.g., meters per second), additional information about the radius of the rotating object is needed.

> **Remember:** RPM quantifies *how fast* something spins, not how fast it moves through space. If you know the radius, you can determine the **linear speed** at the edge of the rotating object.

## üåç Applications

### Mechanical and Automotive Engineering
- **Car engines:** RPM indicates how fast the engine's crankshaft spins, influencing power and fuel efficiency.
- **Electric motors:** RPM helps in selecting motors for specific tasks, such as fans or conveyor belts.
- **Watches and clocks:** Mechanical watches often specify gear rotations in rpm for precision.

### Industrial and Manufacturing Processes
- **Machinery operation:** Rotational speeds are critical for ensuring safety and efficiency during machining.
- **CNC machines:** RPM controls cutting tools' speed to optimize material removal and finish.
- **Printing presses:** RPM controls the speed of rollers and cylinders to ensure consistent printing quality.

### Entertainment and Sports
- **Turntables:** RPM determines the playback speed of vinyl records (e.g., 33‚Öì, 45, or 78 rpm).
- **Bicycle wheels:** RPM is used to analyze cycling speed and cadence.
- **Amusement park rides:** Rotational speeds are specified in rpm for safety and thrill factors.

## üîÑ Quick Conversions

- **1 rpm** = **1 revolution per 60 seconds**  
- **1 rpm** ‚âà **0.10472 radians/sec**  
- **1 rpm** ‚âà **6 degrees/sec**  
- **To convert rpm to linear velocity (v):**  
  \[
  v = \text{rpm} \times \frac{2\pi r}{60}
  \]
  where \(r\) is the radius in meters, and \(v\) will be in meters per second.
