# Nautical Miles per Hour (kn)

Nautical Miles per Hour, commonly abbreviated as **kn** or **knot**, is a unit of **velocity** primarily used in maritime and aviation contexts. One knot equals **one nautical mile per hour**.

### Relationship to other units:
- **1 knot = 1 nautical mile/hour**
- **1 nautical mile ≈ 1.852 kilometers ≈ 1.15078 miles**
- **1 knot ≈ 1.687 feet per second**

This means that when a ship or airplane travels at 10 knots, it covers 10 nautical miles every hour, which translates to approximately 18.52 kilometers per hour.

> **Note:** The knot is a standard unit in navigation because it relates directly to the Earth's geography, making it ideal for measuring distances over the sea and air.

## 🌍 Applications

### Maritime Navigation
- Ships and boats often measure their speed in knots to navigate accurately across oceans and seas.
- Maritime traffic control and shipping logistics rely on knot measurements for scheduling and safety.
- Weather forecasts for maritime routes use knots to describe wind speeds, crucial for voyage planning.

### Aviation
- Pilots use knots for airspeed indicators, especially during cruise and approach phases.
- Flight navigation systems incorporate knots to provide consistent speed data over long distances.
- Air traffic controllers communicate aircraft speeds in knots to coordinate safe separation.

### Sports & Recreation
- Sailing races and regattas often measure boat speeds in knots.
- Recreational sailors and yachters track their velocity to optimize performance.
- Windsurfing and kiteboarding speeds are sometimes expressed in knots, especially for competitive racing.

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- The term **"knot"** originated in the age of sail when sailors used a **chip log** — a wooden panel attached to a rope with knots at regular intervals — to estimate a ship’s speed.
- The **nautical mile** is based on the Earth's circumference; one nautical mile is defined as **one minute of latitude**.
- Despite its nautical origin, knots are used worldwide in both **marine and aviation industries**, making it a universal standard for speed measurement at sea and in the air.
