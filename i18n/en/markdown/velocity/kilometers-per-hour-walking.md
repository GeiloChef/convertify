# Kilometers per Hour (km/h)

Kilometers per Hour (km/h) is a unit of **velocity** that measures how many kilometers an object travels in one hour. It is widely used to express speeds in everyday life, especially in contexts like traveling, transportation, and sports. 

**Relationship to other units:**  
- 1 km/h equals **1000 meters per hour**.  
- To convert km/h to meters per second (m/s), divide the speed by **3.6**.  
- Conversely, to convert m/s to km/h, multiply by **3.6**.

> **Note:** The km/h unit combines the metric distance (kilometers) with time (hours), making it convenient for describing relatively high speeds over longer distances.

## 🌍 Applications

### Transportation
- **Car speeds** on highways are often expressed in km/h, e.g., "The speed limit is 100 km/h."  
- **Bicycle speeds** for casual riding typically range from 15 to 30 km/h.  
- **Running and walking** speeds are also measured in km/h to compare performance.

### Sports & Fitness
- **Marathon runners** often maintain speeds around 12–20 km/h during races.  
- **Cyclists** can reach speeds of 40 km/h or more in competitive cycling events.  
- **Walking pace** for most adults averages about 4–6 km/h.

### Scientific & Educational Contexts
- **Velocity calculations** in physics problems often use km/h for ease of understanding large distances and durations.  
- **Tracking movement** of animals or vehicles over long distances often involves km/h as a standard unit.

## 📏 Unit Comparisons

| Unit             | Description                         | Equivalent in km/h                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **m/s (meters per second)** | Common SI unit for velocity          | Multiply by 3.6 to get km/h                     |
| **mph (miles per hour)**     | Used mainly in the US and UK          | 1 mph ≈ 1.609 km/h                              |
| **kn (knots)**                | Used in maritime and aviation contexts | 1 knot ≈ 1.852 km/h                            |

| Conversion Example | Calculation                                    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 10 m/s             | 10 × 3.6 = **36 km/h**                        |
| 60 mph             | 60 × 1.609 ≈ **96.54 km/h**                   |
| 20 knots           | 20 × 1.852 = **37.04 km/h**                   |

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- The fastest recorded human running speed is about **44 km/h**, achieved by Usain Bolt during his record-breaking sprints.  
- Commercial airplanes typically cruise at around **800–900 km/h**, far faster than any land vehicle!  
- The term "kilometers per hour" was first officially used in the early 20th century as automobiles became more common.
