# Wind Speed (m/s)

Wind speed is a measure of how fast air moves past a specific point, expressed in meters per second (m/s). It is a **unit of velocity**, which describes the rate of change of position over time in a particular direction. 

Since velocity is a vector quantity, wind speed indicates the magnitude of the wind's velocity, often accompanied by wind direction. 

**Conversion note:**  
- 1 m/s ≈ 3.6 km/h  
- 1 m/s ≈ 2.237 mph

Understanding wind speed in meters per second helps meteorologists, engineers, and environmental scientists evaluate and compare wind conditions effectively.

|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Meter per second**       | m/s            | 1 m/s                                             | Standard SI unit for wind speed             |
| **Kilometer per hour**      | km/h           | 3.6 km/h (since 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h)               | Common in weather reports                   |
| **Miles per hour**          | mph            | ≈ 2.237 mph (since 1 m/s ≈ 2.237 mph)           | Used mainly in the USA                      |
| **Knots**                   | kn             | ≈ 1.944 knots (since 1 m/s ≈ 1.944 kn)           | Preferred in maritime and aviation contexts |

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- The **highest recorded wind speed** on Earth was 253 mph (approximately 113 m/s) during Tropical Cyclone Olivia in 1996.
- Wind speeds as low as **0.1 m/s** are enough to sway trees gently, while speeds over **50 m/s** can cause extensive damage and are typical of severe storms.
- The term **"wind"** has been part of human language for thousands of years, with ancient civilizations studying and mythologizing wind patterns.
