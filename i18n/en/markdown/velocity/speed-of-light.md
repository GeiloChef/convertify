# Speed of Light (c)

The **speed of light** in a vacuum, denoted by the symbol **c**, is a fundamental constant of nature. It represents the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel. 

In terms of units, **c** is measured in **meters per second (m/s)**. Its value is approximately **299,792,458 m/s**—a number so large that it’s often rounded to **3 x 10⁸ m/s** for simplicity. 

**Relationship to other units:**

- **1 km/s** = 1,000 m/s
- **Speed of light in km/s** ≈ 299,792 km/s
- **In miles per second:** c ≈ 186,282 mi/s

The speed of light is essential in physics, especially in Einstein's theory of relativity, where it acts as a universal speed limit.

## 📏 Unit Comparisons

| Unit                       | Description                                  | Equivalent in meters                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Meter (m)**             | Standard SI unit of length                   | 1 m                                               |
| **Kilometer (km)**         | Commonly used for distances on land         | 1 km = 1,000 m                                    |
| **Light-year (ly)**        | Distance light travels in one year          | ≈ 9.461 x 10¹⁵ m                                |
| **Astronomical Unit (AU)**  | Average distance from Earth to Sun         | ≈ 1.496 x 10¹¹ m                                |

*Note:* The **speed of light (c)** is a speed, so it is compared here to other length units, especially when considering the distance it covers over a time period.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- The **speed of light** is exactly **299,792,458 m/s** because the meter is defined based on the distance light travels in a specific fraction of a second.
- Nothing with mass can reach or exceed the speed of light; as objects accelerate closer to **c**, their mass effectively increases, making it impossible to surpass this universal limit.
- In a vacuum, **light** is the fastest thing in the universe, but in certain media like glass or water, light slows down, reducing its speed relative to **c**.
