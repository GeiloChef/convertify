# Mach (Mach number)

The **Mach** number is a dimensionless unit used to express the speed of an object relative to the **speed of sound** in the surrounding medium (usually air). It is named after the Austrian physicist **Ernst Mach**. 

**Definition:**  
> **Mach number (M)** = **Object's speed (v)** / **Speed of sound in the medium (a)**

This means that if an airplane travels at **Mach 1**, it is moving at exactly the speed of sound in that environment. If it travels at **Mach 2**, it is moving twice as fast as the speed of sound.

**Conversion to other units:**  
- The Mach number is **dimensionless**; it doesn't have units on its own.  
- To convert to a velocity in meters per second (m/s), multiply the Mach number by the local speed of sound.  
- The **speed of sound** varies with temperature, humidity, altitude, and medium, but at sea level under standard conditions (~20¬∞C), it is approximately **343 m/s** (about **1235 km/h** or **767 mph**).

> **Important:**  
> The Mach number depends on environmental conditions because the **speed of sound** varies with temperature and medium properties.

## üåç Applications

### Aerospace & Aviation
- **Supersonic flight:** Aircraft like the Concorde or military jets often fly at speeds above Mach 1.
- **Design of aircraft and missiles:** Engineers consider Mach numbers to optimize aerodynamics and stability.
- **Speed measurement:** Mach is used to describe the speed of fast-moving aircraft, missiles, and space vehicles.

### Meteorology & Environmental Science
- **Studying shock waves:** When lightning or volcanic eruptions produce shock waves, their speeds can be described in Mach units.
- **High-altitude aviation:** As altitude increases, the speed of sound decreases, affecting Mach calculations for aircraft.

### Physics & Engineering
- **Shock wave research:** Mach numbers are critical when studying supersonic and hypersonic phenomena.
- **Flow dynamics:** Engineers analyze how fluids behave at different Mach regimes to improve propulsion systems and aerodynamic design.

|------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Mach 0.1**     | Subsonic, slow aircraft or objects           | Walking speed (~0.03 km/h)                  |
| **Mach 1**       | Speed of sound in air (~343 m/s at sea level)| Commercial jets (~1225 km/h)                 |
| **Mach 5**       | Hypersonic speeds, space re-entry velocities| Re-entry capsules (~6000 km/h)              |
| **Speed of sound** | Variable depending on conditions             | ~343 m/s at sea level, ~1235 km/h             |

*Note:* The actual velocity in km/h or mph depends on the local speed of sound, which varies with environmental factors.

## üåü Fun Facts

- **Historical origin:** The Mach number was introduced by Ernst Mach in the 19th century to describe the speed of shock waves produced by supersonic objects.
- **Hypersonic realm:** Speeds above **Mach 5** are called hypersonic, and they involve complex physics like intense heat and shock interactions.
- **Speed of sound variation:** In water, the speed of sound is about **1482 m/s**, making Mach numbers in underwater applications significantly different from those in air.
