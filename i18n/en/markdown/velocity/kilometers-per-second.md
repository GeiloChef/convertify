# Kilometers per second (km/s)

Kilometers per second (km/s) is a unit of velocity that measures how many kilometers an object travels in one second. It is widely used in fields where high speeds are involved, especially in astronomy, astrophysics, and space science. 

**Conversion to other units:**
- 1 km/s = 1,000 meters per second (m/s)
- 1 km/s ≈ 0.621 miles per second (mi/s)
- 1 km/s = 3,600 kilometers per hour (km/h)

Because it involves large distances and rapid speeds, km/s is ideal for describing velocities of celestial objects and spacecraft.

## 🌍 Applications

### Astronomy and Space Exploration
- **Orbital velocities:** Satellites orbiting Earth typically travel at about 7.8 km/s.
- **Interplanetary travel:** Spacecraft like Voyager 1 move at speeds around 17 km/s relative to the Sun.
- **Comet velocities:** Comets can travel through the solar system at speeds exceeding 50 km/s.

### Physics and High-Speed Phenomena
- **Particle physics:** Particles in accelerators can reach speeds close to the speed of light, but some cosmic rays travel at several km/s.
- **Shock waves:** Velocities of shock waves in astrophysical plasmas are often measured in km/s.

### Earth and Atmospheric Science
- **Meteor speeds:** Meteors streak across the sky at speeds ranging from 11 km/s to over 72 km/s.
- **Jet streams:** These high-altitude winds in Earth's atmosphere blow at around 100–200 km/h, which is much slower but still interesting for atmospheric dynamics.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- **Interplanetary speeds:** The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977, travels at about 17 km/s, making it one of the fastest human-made objects in space.
- **Cosmic speed:** To escape Earth's gravity, an object must reach approximately 11.2 km/s, known as escape velocity.
- **Speed of meteors:** Some meteors can enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds over 70 km/s, creating spectacular fireballs.
