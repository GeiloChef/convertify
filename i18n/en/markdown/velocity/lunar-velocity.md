# Lunar velocity (v<sub>moon</sub>)

Lunar velocity refers to the speed at which the Moon travels through space relative to Earth or other reference points. It is typically measured in **meters per second (m/s)** or **kilometers per hour (km/h)**. This unit helps us understand how quickly the Moon moves along its orbit around Earth. 

In terms of conversions, **lunar velocity** is closely related to the general concept of velocity, which is distance traveled over time. For example:
- The Moon's orbital speed is approximately **1.022 km/s**.
- To convert lunar velocity into other units:
  - 1 km/s = 1,000 m/s
  - 1 km/h = 0.27778 m/s

Understanding lunar velocity provides insight into celestial mechanics and the dynamics of our Earth-Moon system.

## üåç Applications

## üåü Fun Facts

- The Moon travels around Earth at an average velocity of approximately **1.022 km/s**, which is about **3,700 km/h**‚Äîfast enough to circle the globe in roughly 27.3 days!
- Despite its high orbital speed, the Moon's gravity keeps it in a stable orbit, preventing it from flying away into space.
- The Moon's velocity varies slightly due to its elliptical orbit, reaching up to **1.08 km/s** at perihelion (closest point) and slowing to about **1.00 km/s** at apogee (farthest point).
