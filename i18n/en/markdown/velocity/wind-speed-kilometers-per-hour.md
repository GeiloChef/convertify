# Wind Speed (km/h)

Wind Speed (km/h) is a measurement of how fast the air is moving horizontally across a given point, expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h). It is a specific way to quantify **velocity**, which is the rate at which an object changes its position. In this case, the "object" is the air, and the "change in position" is the movement of air particles across space.

**Relationship to other units:**

- 1 km/h = 0.27778 m/s
- 1 km/h ≈ 0.1719 mph (miles per hour)
- To convert from m/s to km/h, multiply by 3.6
- Wind speed is often reported in **knots** in maritime contexts: 1 knot ≈ 1.852 km/h

Understanding wind speed in km/h helps meteorologists, sailors, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts gauge weather conditions effectively.

## 🌍 Applications

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- The highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth was approximately **253 mph (407 km/h)** during a tornado in Oklahoma in 1999.
- Wind speeds in hurricanes can reach up to **300 km/h** or more, creating devastating conditions.
- The Beaufort Wind Scale, developed in the early 19th century, classifies wind speeds from **calm** (0 km/h) to **hurricane** (>118 km/h), providing a historical way to estimate wind velocity based on observed conditions.

## 🔄 Quick Conversions
- 1 km/h = 0.27778 m/s
- 1 km/h = 0.1719 mph
- 1 km/h = 0.54 knots
- 1 km/h = 328.08 ft/min
