# Square Meter (m²)

The **square meter (m²)** is the standard unit of area in the International System of Units (SI). It represents the area of a square with sides measuring exactly **one meter** in length. The square meter is a fundamental unit used worldwide to quantify size and space in various fields, from construction to geography.

**Relationship to other units:**
- 1 hectare = 10,000 m²
- 1 square kilometer (km²) = 1,000,000 m²
- 1 square centimeter (cm²) = 0.0001 m²
- 1 square inch (in²) ≈ 0.00064516 m²

In essence, the square meter helps us understand and compare the size of different surfaces and areas in a consistent way.

## 🌍 Applications

### Architecture and Construction
- Measuring the floor area of homes, offices, and commercial buildings.
- Calculating the amount of flooring material needed (tiles, carpet, hardwood).
- Planning outdoor landscaping and garden areas.

### Geography and Land Use
- Mapping land plots and property boundaries.
- Estimating agricultural fields and crop areas.
- Analyzing urban development and city planning.

### Everyday Life
- Determining the size of a piece of furniture or an appliance.
- Estimating paint needed for walls or ceilings.
- Understanding the size of a park or sports field.
