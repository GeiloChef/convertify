# Square Kilometer (km²)

The **square kilometer (km²)** is a unit of area measurement used primarily to describe large expanses of land or surface areas. It is derived from the **kilometer (km)**, which itself is a metric unit of length equal to 1,000 meters. When measuring area, a square kilometer represents a square with sides of one kilometer each.

### Relationship to Other Units
- 1 km = 1,000 meters (m)
- 1 km² = (1 km) × (1 km) = 1,000 m × 1,000 m = **1,000,000 m²**
- In terms of smaller units:
  - 1 km² = 1,000,000 square meters
  - 1 km² = 100 hectares (ha) (since 1 ha = 10,000 m²)

**Conversions to other area units:**
- 1 km² = 0.3861 square miles (sq mi)
- 1 km² = 247.1 acres

## 🌍 Applications

**Square kilometers** are used to measure large geographic areas, such as countries, cities, parks, and natural features.

### Geography & Land Planning
- Calculating the size of countries or states (e.g., Canada ≈ 9.98 million km²).
- Mapping national parks and reserves.
- Planning urban expansion over large areas.

### Environmental Science
- Assessing the extent of forests, deserts, or wetlands.
- Monitoring land use changes over vast regions.
- Estimating the surface area affected by natural disasters like floods or wildfires.

### Space & Astronomy
- Describing the surface area of planets or moons.
- Measuring large-scale features on planetary surfaces.
- Calculating the area covered by satellite images.
