# Square Inch (sq in)

The **square inch (sq in)** is a unit of area measurement commonly used in the United States and other countries that prefer imperial units. It represents the area of a square with sides measuring exactly one inch. Since one inch equals **2.54 centimeters**, the square inch is also related to metric units of area. To convert square inches to square centimeters, multiply by **6.4516** (since 1 in² = 6.4516 cm²). Conversely, to convert from square centimeters to square inches, divide by 6.4516.

**In summary:**
- 1 sq in = 6.4516 cm²
- 1 cm² ≈ 0.155 sq in

The square inch is often used in various fields such as manufacturing, real estate, and design, especially where precise measurements of small surfaces are needed.
