# Kilobyte (KB)

A **kilobyte (KB)** is a unit of digital information used to measure data size. In the context of data storage and transfer, it is a common unit that helps us understand the amount of information contained in files, documents, and media.

- **1 kilobyte** is typically equal to **1,000 bytes** in the decimal system (used by most storage manufacturers and networking standards).
- In the binary system (more common in computer science), **1 kilobyte** is **1,024 bytes** (2^10 bytes).

### Relationship to other units:
- 1 KB ‚âà 1,000 bytes (decimal)
- 1 KB = 1,024 bytes (binary)
- 1 megabyte (MB) = 1,000 KB (decimal) or 1,024 KB (binary)

> **Note:** When discussing data sizes, be aware of whether the context uses decimal (base 10) or binary (base 2) conventions.

## üåç Applications

### Digital Storage

- **File sizes:** Text documents, emails, and small images often measure in kilobytes.
- **Device storage:** Early computers and storage devices used kilobytes to specify capacity.
- **Web pages:** Basic web pages with plain text typically range from a few KBs to hundreds of KBs.

### Data Transfer & Networking

- **Email attachments:** Small images or documents attached to emails are often a few KBs.
- **Web downloads:** Small software patches or updates might be a few hundred KBs.
- **Streaming quality:** Low-resolution images or audio clips may be measured in kilobytes.

### Educational & Programming Contexts

- **Learning tools:** Students often encounter kilobytes when learning about data sizes.
- **Coding and debugging:** Logs or small data files stored temporarily are measured in KBs.
- **Embedded systems:** Microcontrollers with limited memory often work within capacity measured in KBs.

## üåü Fun Facts

- The term **"kilobyte"** originally referred to 1,024 bytes in early computing, aligning with the binary system, but today, it is often used to mean 1,000 bytes due to decimal standards.
- A typical **email attachment** of a plain text message is usually just a few KBs, making it easy to send multiple attachments without much bandwidth.
- Early **computer memory modules** were measured in kilobytes‚Äîmodern devices now operate in gigabytes or terabytes, but the KB remains a fundamental teaching unit.
