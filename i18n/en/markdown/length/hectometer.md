# Hectometer (hm)

A **hectometer (hm)** is a unit of length in the **metric system**, equal to **one hundred meters**:

> **1 hm = 100 meters (10² m) = 0.1 kilometers (km)**

Although not commonly used in daily life, the hectometer is sometimes used in **agriculture, land measurement, and hydrology**.

## 🌍 Applications of the Hectometer

### **🔹 Land & Agriculture**
- A **hectare (ha)**, a common unit for measuring land, is a square **100 meters × 100 meters** (**1 hm²**).
- Large **fields and farms** are sometimes measured in **hectometers**.
- **Irrigation systems** often span several **hectometers** in length.

### **🔹 Hydrology & Geography**
- The **depth of deep lakes** can be measured in **hectometers** (e.g., Lake Superior is **over 200 hm deep**).
- The **width of large rivers** like the Amazon can exceed **10 hm** in certain areas.
- **Mountain elevations** sometimes use hectometers for easier measurement (e.g., a 3,000-meter peak is **30 hm high**).

### **🔹 Athletics & Sports**
- A **standard outdoor running track** is **0.4 hm** (400 meters) long.
- The **length of a football field**, including end zones, is **1.1 hm**.
- A **rowing competition course** can be **20 hm** long.
