# Link (li)

The **link (li)** is a historic unit of length used primarily in **land surveying**, especially in combination with the **chain**. It was invented by **Edmund Gunter** in the early 17th century as part of a standardized system of measurement for land.

> **1 link = 0.66 feet = 7.92 inches = 0.201168 meters**  
> **100 links = 1 chain**  
> **1,000 links = 1 furlong**  
> **8,000 links = 1 mile**

Gunter’s measuring chain was exactly **66 feet long and divided into 100 links**, making calculations with decimals much easier for surveyors.

## 🌍 Applications of the Link

### 🔹 **Surveying & Mapping**
- Links were essential in early **land subdivision** and **boundary surveying**.
- They allowed for **precise yet manageable measurements** on the field.
- Many **property deeds** in the U.S., UK, and Commonwealth countries still reference links.

### 🔹 **Public Land Survey System (PLSS)**
- The **U.S. PLSS** used links extensively to divide territory into townships, sections, and lots.
- **Legal descriptions** of old properties often still use links.

### 🔹 **Railroad and Infrastructure Planning**
- Early **railroad and canal engineers** employed links for incremental distance measurement.
- Surveyors preferred links for detailed planning over long distances.
