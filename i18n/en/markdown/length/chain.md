# Chain (ch)

A **chain (ch)** is a traditional unit of length primarily used in **surveying, land measurement, and railways**. It was originally introduced by **Edmund Gunter in 1620** as part of a standardized system for land division.

> **1 chain = 66 feet = 22 yards = 20.1168 meters (0.201168 km)**  
> **1 chain = 1/10 of a furlong**  
> **1 chain = 1/80 of a mile**

Chains were widely used in **British and American land surveys** and are still referenced in some areas today.
