# Parsec (pc)

A parsec is a unit of length used in astronomy to measure distances to objects outside the Solar System. It stands for "parallax arcsecond" and is equivalent to about 3.26 light-years. 

## 🌍 Applications

- **Astronomy**
  - Determining the distance between stars and galaxies
  - Calculating the size of the Milky Way galaxy
  - Studying the expansion of the universe

- **Science**
  - Measuring the vast distances in the universe
  - Providing a standard unit for astronomical calculations

- **Technology**
  - Used in spacecraft navigation
  - Informing the design of telescopes and observatories

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- The term "parsec" comes from the method of measuring astronomical distances using parallax, a change in the apparent position of an object when viewed from different locations.
- The closest star to Earth, Proxima Centauri, is about 1.3 parsecs away.
- The famous Kessel Run in "Star Wars" is measured in parsecs, even though it's a unit of distance and not time.
