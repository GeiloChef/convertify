## 🐎 Origins & History

The unit originates from the **ancient practice** of using the width of a human hand—**excluding the thumb**—to measure height. The hand has been used since at least **Ancient Egypt**, and it became standardized over time for practical and trade-related reasons.

The **British Weights and Measures Act of 1541** officially defined a hand as **exactly 4 inches**, and that definition remains in use today.

## 🌍 Usage in Equestrian Measurement

The hand is **almost exclusively used** today to measure the **height of horses** from the ground to the **withers** (the highest point of the shoulders, not the head).

Heights are usually given in a mixed format, like:

- **15.2 h** → 15 hands + 2 inches = **62 inches**
- **16.0 h** → 16 hands exactly = **64 inches**

> Note: The decimal isn't really a decimal! The number after the point is **in inches**, not a fraction.
