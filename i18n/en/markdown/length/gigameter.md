# Gigameter (Gm)

A **gigameter (Gm)** is a unit of length in the **metric system**, equal to **one billion meters**:

> **1 Gm = 1,000,000,000 meters (10⁹ m) = 1,000,000 km**

This unit is primarily used in **astronomy and space science** to measure vast distances between planets and stars.

## 🌍 Applications of the Gigameter

### **🔹 Astronomy & Space Science**
- **The distance from the Earth to the Sun** is approximately **150 Gm**.
- **Jupiter’s orbit around the Sun** spans about **778 Gm**.
- The diameter of the **Solar System** (up to Pluto’s orbit) is roughly **12,000 Gm**.

### **🔹 Planetary Measurements**
- **The diameter of the Sun** is about **1.39 Gm**.
- The **distance from Mars to the Sun** varies between **206 Gm and 249 Gm**.
- **Neptune’s orbit** is approximately **4,500 Gm** from the Sun.

## 📏 Gigameter in Comparison

| Unit | Equivalent in Gigameters |
