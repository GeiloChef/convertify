# Micrometer (µm)

A **micrometer (µm)**, also known as a **micron**, is a unit of length in the **metric system** equal to **one-millionth of a meter**:

> **1 µm = 0.000001 meters (10⁻⁶ m) = 0.001 mm**

It is commonly used in **science, engineering, and medicine** to measure extremely small objects, such as **cells, bacteria, and microchips**.

## 🔬 Applications of the Micrometer

### **🔹 Biology & Medicine**
- The average diameter of a **human red blood cell** is **7–8 µm**.
- **Bacteria** can range from **0.2 µm (small) to 5 µm (large)**.
- A **human hair** is typically **50–100 µm thick**, meaning it is around **10 times wider than a red blood cell**.

### **🔹 Engineering & Technology**
- **Microchips & Semiconductors**: Modern computer chips are built with transistors as small as **5 nm to 100 µm**.
- **Thin film coatings** (used on glasses, screens, and lenses) are often measured in micrometers.

### **🔹 Environmental Science**
- **PM2.5 pollution** (dangerous airborne particles) are defined as **smaller than 2.5 µm**, which allows them to penetrate deep into human lungs.

## 📏 Micrometer in Comparison

| Unit | Equivalent in Micrometers |
|------|---------------------------|
| **1 millimeter (mm)** | 1,000 µm |
| **1 nanometer (nm)** | 0.001 µm |
| **1 human hair** | 50–100 µm |
| **1 grain of fine sand** | 90 µm |
| **1 dust particle** | ~2–10 µm |

## 🌍 Interesting Facts
- The smallest things visible to the **naked eye** are about **40–50 µm** in size.
- **Laser printers** have resolutions measured in **micrometers**, with some achieving **1200 dpi (dots per inch), meaning each dot is ~20 µm wide**.
- A **spider’s silk fiber** is about **3–5 µm** thick.

## 🔄 Quick Conversions
- **1 µm = 0.001 mm** (1 thousandth of a millimeter)
- **1 µm = 1000 nm** (1000 nanometers)
- **1 µm ≈ 0.00003937 inches**
