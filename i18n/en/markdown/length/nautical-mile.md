# Nautical Mile (NM or nmi)

The **nautical mile** is a unit of length used primarily in **navigation**, **aviation**, and **maritime law**. It is based on the **circumference of the Earth**, making it especially useful for charting distances over water and air.

> **1 nautical mile = 1,852 meters = approximately 1.1508 miles**

## 🌍 Definition & Origin

The nautical mile is defined as:

> **The length of one minute of arc along a meridian of the Earth.**

Historically, because the Earth is a sphere, it was divided into **360 degrees**, each degree into **60 minutes**—making **21,600 minutes** of arc in total. The distance corresponding to one of these minutes became the **nautical mile**.

In **1929**, the nautical mile was officially defined internationally as **1,852 meters**. The United States adopted this definition in **1954**, replacing earlier slightly different values.

## 🛥️ Usage in Navigation & Aviation

Nautical miles are used for:

- **Measuring distances at sea or in the air**
- **Flight planning and marine charts**
- **International treaties and territorial waters**

Because the Earth is a globe, the nautical mile aligns naturally with **latitude and longitude**, making it the **most practical unit for global travel**.
