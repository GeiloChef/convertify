# Terabytes per Second (TBps)

Terabytes per second (TBps) is a unit of data transfer rate that measures how many terabytes of data are transmitted or processed in one second. It is commonly used in high-speed data communications, data centers, and large-scale computing environments. 

**1 Terabyte (TB)** equals **1,000 Gigabytes (GB)** or **1,000,000 Megabytes (MB)**. When expressed in data transfer rates, 1 TBps indicates that 1 terabyte of data moves through a system every second, showcasing extremely rapid data flow.

### Conversion to Other Units

- **1 TBps = 1,000 GBps**
- **1 GBps = 1,000 MBps**
- **1 MBps = 1,000 KBps**
- **1 KBps = 1,000 bytes per second**

*For example, a data transfer rate of 2 TBps means 2 terabytes of data are transmitted each second, which is equivalent to 2,000 gigabytes per second.*

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 Terabyte per second (TBps) | 1,000 GBps                                | Common in high-speed data transfer scenarios          |
| 1 Gigabyte per second (GBps) | 1,000 MBps                                | Typical for high-end enterprise networks             |
| 1 Megabyte per second (MBps) | 1,000 KBps                                | Used in consumer internet speeds, though slower now  |
| 1 Kilobyte per second (KBps) | 1,000 bytes/sec                          | Basic data rate for very slow connections            |

*Note:* Data transfer rates are often expressed in bits per second (bps). To convert from bytes to bits, multiply by 8.
